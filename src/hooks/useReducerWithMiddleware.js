/**
 * Same as React's useReducer, but also executes middleware functions on every
 * action dispatch.
 *
 * A middleware is a powerful and flexible function that can
 * - dispatch arbitrary actions, e.g. at an interval
 * - inspect all the dispatched actions
 * - change an action before it reaches the reducer or next middleware
 * - stop an action from propagating altogether
 *
 * The middleware interface is designed to be exactly the same as Redux's
 * middlewares - the middleware function must have the following form:
 ```js
  ({getState}) => {
    return (next) =>
      return (action) => {
        next(action);
      }
    }
  }
 ```
 * A middleware function must call `next(action)` to propagate the action to
 * the final action dispatch and reducer, otherwise the action will be ignored.
 *
 * Middlewares are executed in reverse order.
 *
 * @param {Array<Function>} middlewares Middleware functions, executed in reverse order
 * @param {Function} reducer Passed to React's useReducer
 * @param {any} initOrInitialValue Passed to React's useReducer
 * @param {any} init Passed to React's useReducer
 * @return {Array} of [state, dispatch]
